2. About Me
Header: Hi, I’m Godwin Jonathan.
Body: I’m a Nigerian-born changemaker currently based in Kigali, Rwanda. My work is driven by one simple belief: opportunity should not be a privilege. I founded The Africa Initiative to bridge gaps in capital and competency for African startups, and I’m currently building Atlas Africa, a smart investment platform that reimagines how early-stage founders access funding, coaching, and community.
From my early work leading community education programs to representing African youth on global stages, every step has been about solving real problems and building structures that last. I bring clarity, strategy, and soul into everything I build.
